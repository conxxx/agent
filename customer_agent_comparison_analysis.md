# Analysis of Customer Service Agent Code: `customer_servicenew` vs. Current `customer_service`

Date of Analysis: 2025-05-21

## 1. Overall Assessment

The code in the `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew` directory largely appears to be an **earlier, significantly less functional, or refactored (and incomplete) version** of the customer service agent compared to the current implementation in `agents/customer-service/customer_service`.

The `customer_servicenew` version exhibits several regressions and missing features, making the current `customer_service` implementation far more advanced and aligned with the project's recent progress as documented in the memory bank.

## 2. Key Regressions and Issues in `customer_servicenew`

*   **Mocked Tools:** Most tools that should interact with a backend (e.g., cart access, product recommendations, availability checks) are **mock implementations** in `customer_servicenew/toolsnew.py`. In contrast, the current `customer_service/tools/tools.py` features tools integrated with backend APIs via HTTP requests.
*   **Missing Tools:** Several critical tools present in the current agent are entirely absent from `customer_servicenew/toolsnew.py` and its corresponding agent registration (`agent new.py`) and prompts (`promptsnew.py`). These include:
    *   `search_products` (for querying products via API)
    *   `format_product_recommendations_for_display` (for structuring product card data for the UI)
    *   `set_website_theme` (for UI theme control)
    *   `initiate_checkout_ui` (for triggering the checkout process)
*   **Simplified Prompts:** `customer_servicenew/promptsnew.py` lacks the detailed interaction flows, nuanced guidance (e.g., for image handling, silent cart checks, specific product search sequences), and comprehensive tool descriptions found in the current `customer_service/prompts.py`. The current prompts enable more sophisticated and context-aware agent behavior.
*   **Configuration Deficiencies:**
    *   `customer_servicenew/confignew.py` is missing the `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` setting, which is crucial for tools to connect to the e-commerce backend.
    *   It specifies `model: str = Field(default="gemini-2.0-flash-001")`, which is not a "live" model. The current agent uses `"gemini-2.0-flash-live-preview-04-09"`, necessary for features like voice and video streaming.
*   **Structural and Import Issues:**
    *   `customer_servicenew` has a flat file structure. Several files within it (e.g., `agent new.py`, `callbacksnew.py`, `promptsnew.py`) contain relative import statements (e.g., `from .entities.customer import Customer`, `from .tools.tools import ...`) that assume a sub-directory structure (`entities/`, `tools/`) which does not exist in `customer_servicenew`. These would likely cause runtime import errors.
*   **Outdated Dependencies (Potentially):** While `customer_servicenew/pyprojectnew.toml` lists a newer version of `google-cloud-aiplatform` (`^1.93.0` vs. `^1.88.0`), it critically omits the `requests` library, which is essential for the API-integrated tools in the current agent.
*   **Stale README:** `customer_servicenew/READMEnew.md` (and largely the main `agents/customer-service/README.md`) describes an agent with mocked tools and does not reflect the capabilities of the current API-integrated agent. It also contains incorrect file path references if it were to describe the `customer_servicenew` files.

## 3. File-by-File Comparison Summary
### 3.1. Agent Core Logic (`agent new.py` vs. `agent.py`)

This section compares the core agent logic found in `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/agent new.py` (referred to as "New") and `agents/customer-service/customer_service/agent.py` (referred to as "Current/Older").

*   **File Paths:**
    *   New: `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/agent new.py`
    *   Current/Older: `agents/customer-service/customer_service/agent.py`
    *   Import paths within each file are relative (e.g., `from .config import Config`). These paths are correct respective to their own directory structures (`customer_servicenew` for the New file, `customer_service` for the Current/Older file). The primary difference is the parent directory for these modules. For example, `from .config` in the New file refers to a `config.py` within `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/`, while in the Current/Older file it refers to a `config.py` within `agents/customer-service/customer_service/`.

*   **Key Differences & Observations:**
    *   **Registered Tools:**
        *   The New file (`agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/agent new.py`) lists 12 tools.
        *   The Current/Older file (`agents/customer-service/customer_service/agent.py`) lists 15 tools.
        *   **Difference:** The New file does **not** include the following tools found in the Current/Older version:
            *   `search_products` (imported in Current/Older from `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py`)
            *   `format_product_recommendations_for_display` (defined in Current/Older in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/agent.py`)
            *   `set_website_theme` (imported in Current/Older from `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py`)
    *   **Callbacks:**
        *   The New file (`agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/agent new.py`) registers `before_tool_callback`, `after_tool_callback`, `before_agent_callback`, and `before_model_callback`. It imports `after_tool` from `.shared_libraries.callbacks` (implying `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/shared_libraries/callbacks.py`).
        *   The Current/Older file (`agents/customer-service/customer_service/agent.py`) registers `before_tool_callback`, `before_agent_callback`, and `before_model_callback`. It does **not** import or register an `after_tool_callback` (callback import from `agents/customer-service/customer_service/shared_libraries/callbacks.py`).
        *   **Difference:** The New file **includes** an `after_tool_callback`, which is absent in the Current/Older file.
    *   **Helper Functions:**
        *   The New file (`agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/agent new.py`) defines no local helper functions.
        *   The Current/Older file (`agents/customer-service/customer_service/agent.py`) defines two helper functions:
            *   `_prepare_product_recommendation_payload`
            *   `format_product_recommendations_for_display` (which was also registered as a tool).
        *   **Difference:** The New file **lacks** the helper functions present in the Current/Older version. This is consistent with the removal of the `format_product_recommendations_for_display` tool.
    *   **Overall Structure:**
        *   The New file is shorter (74 lines vs. 147 lines for the Current/Older file), primarily due to the absence of the helper functions and associated logic/comments.
        *   The Current/Older file contains comments related to `DatabaseSessionService` configuration and notes about added tools, which are not present in the New file.

*   **Conclusion for Agent Core Logic:**
    *   The "New" `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/agent new.py` appears to be a refactored or simplified version compared to the "Current/Older" `agents/customer-service/customer_service/agent.py`.
    *   Key changes in the New version include the removal of three tools (`search_products`, `format_product_recommendations_for_display`, `set_website_theme`) and their associated helper functions.
    *   Conversely, the New version has re-introduced or added an `after_tool_callback` that was not present in the Current/Older version.
    *   These changes suggest a potential shift in responsibilities or a streamlining of the agent's core functionalities in the newer version. The removal of product search/formatting tools might indicate these are handled differently or are no longer part of this specific agent's direct responsibilities. The addition of `after_tool_callback` suggests new post-tool-execution logic.
### 3.2. Callbacks (`callbacksnew.py` vs. `shared_libraries/callbacks.py`)

This section compares the new callback definitions in `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/callbacksnew.py` with the current ones in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/shared_libraries/callbacks.py`.

*   **File Paths:**
    *   New: `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/callbacksnew.py`
    *   Current: `agents/customer-service/customer_service/shared_libraries/callbacks.py`

*   **Key Differences & Observations:**

    *   **Imports:**
        *   Both files import `Customer` using `from customer_service.entities.customer import Customer`. The path for `callbacksnew.py` might require specific `PYTHONPATH` adjustments depending on whether `customer_servicenew` is intended to be the package root.
        *   Other ADK and standard library imports are identical. The current `callbacks.py` contains comments indicating when certain type hints like `Optional`, `Tuple`, and `State` were added.

    *   **`rate_limit_callback` function:**
        *   The core logic, constants (`RATE_LIMIT_SECS`, `RPM_QUOTA`), and logging are **identical** in both files.
        *   Both include logic to ensure `part.text` in `llm_request` is not an empty string.

    *   **`validate_customer_id` function:**
        *   **Logging:** `callbacks.py` features significantly more detailed logging (debug, info, warning, error messages) compared to `callbacksnew.py`, which has no specific internal logging for this function.
        *   **Error Handling:**
            *   `callbacks.py` includes a generic `except Exception as e:` block for unhandled errors during validation, enhancing robustness. `callbacksnew.py` only catches `ValidationError`.
            *   Both log/return similar messages for `ValidationError` and customer ID mismatch.
        *   **Return Type Hint:** `callbacks.py` uses `Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]`, which is more accurate as `None` is returned for the string part on successful validation. `callbacksnew.py` uses `Tuple[bool, str]`.

    *   **`lowercase_value` function:**
        *   This utility function is **identical** in both files.
        *   The current `callbacks.py` includes a comment within `before_tool` noting that this function returns a generator for dictionaries, which might not modify arguments in place as intended without consuming the generator. This observation is absent in `callbacksnew.py`.

    *   **`before_tool` function:**
        *   **Logging:** `callbacks.py` has extensive debug and info logging. `callbacksnew.py` has no logging in this function.
        *   **Customer ID Validation Return:**
            *   If validation fails, `callbacksnew.py` returns the error string directly.
            *   `callbacks.py` returns a structured dictionary: `{"error": err}`, which is generally better for agent error handling.
        *   **`sync_ask_for_approval` Tool Logic:**
            *   The auto-approval message for amounts `<= 10` differs slightly. `callbacksnew.py`: `"You can approve this discount; no manager needed."`. `callbacks.py`: `"Discount auto-approved as per configuration."`.
            *   `callbacks.py` adds an explicit `amount is not None` check before comparing the amount.
        *   **`modify_cart` Tool Logic:** Identical in both.

    *   **`after_tool` function:**
        *   **Logging:** `callbacks.py` provides detailed logging. `callbacksnew.py` has minimal logging (two debug statements).
        *   **Dictionary Access:** `callbacks.py` uses `tool_response.get('status')` for safer access to the `status` key, preventing potential `KeyError`. `callbacksnew.py` accesses it directly (`tool_response['status']`).
        *   **Placeholder Comments:** `callbacks.py` includes comments like `"# Actually make changes to the cart here if needed"`, which are absent in `callbacksnew.py`.

    *   **`before_agent` function:**
        *   This function is **identical** in both files. Both ensure a default `customer_profile` is loaded into the state if not present.

*   **Conclusion for Callbacks:**
    *   The current `shared_libraries/callbacks.py` is generally more robust and developer-friendly than `callbacksnew.py`. This is due to its significantly more comprehensive logging, more resilient error handling (e.g., generic exception catching in `validate_customer_id`, safer dictionary access in `after_tool`), and more structured error returns (e.g., `{"error": ...}` in `before_tool`).
    *   The core logic for most callback functions (`rate_limit_callback`, `lowercase_value`, `before_agent`, and tool-specific business rules within `before_tool` and `after_tool`) remains largely the same or very similar.
    *   The import path for `Customer` in `callbacksnew.py` might need verification based on the intended package structure of the `customer_servicenew` directory.
    *   Minor differences in return messages and type hint accuracy exist, with `callbacks.py` often being slightly more precise or informative.
### 3.3. Configuration (`confignew.py` vs. `config.py`)

This section compares the configuration files from the `customer_servicenew` and `customer_service` agent directories.

*   **File Paths:**
    *   New: `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/confignew.py`
    *   Current: `agents/customer-service/customer_service/config.py`

*   **Key Differences & Observations:**
    *   **`AgentModel` Class:**
        *   The default `model` specified in the `AgentModel` class differs:
            *   `confignew.py`: `model: str = Field(default="gemini-2.0-flash-001")`
            *   `config.py`: `model: str = Field(default="gemini-2.0-flash-live-preview-04-09")`
    *   **`Config` Class:**
        *   The `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` field is present in `config.py` but absent in `confignew.py`.
            *   `config.py`: `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL: str = Field(default="http://127.0.0.1:5000/api")`
            *   `confignew.py`: This field is not defined.
    *   **`env_file` Path Resolution:**
        *   The method for resolving the `.env` file path is consistent across both files: `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), "../.env")`.
    *   **Other Fields:**
        *   All other defined configuration fields within both `AgentModel` (e.g., `name`) and `Config` (e.g., `agent_settings`, `app_name`, `CLOUD_PROJECT`, `CLOUD_LOCATION`, `GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`, `API_KEY`) and their default values appear to be identical.

*   **Conclusion for Configuration:**
    *   The primary differences lie in the default language model specified for the agent and the inclusion of a `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` in the current `config.py`, which is missing in `confignew.py`. The environment file path resolution is consistent. The change in the model name suggests an update or a shift in the preferred model version. The absence of `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` in the new configuration might indicate a refactoring where this setting is no longer needed at this level, or it might be an oversight.
### 3.4. Customer Entity (`customernew.py` vs. `entities/customer.py`)

*   **File Paths:**
    *   New: `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/customernew.py`
    *   Current: `agents/customer-service/customer_service/entities/customer.py`

*   **Key Differences & Observations:**
    *   **Pydantic Models (`Address`, `Product`, `Purchase`, `CommunicationPreferences`, `GardenProfile`, `Customer`):**
        *   All Pydantic model definitions, including their fields, types, and default values (e.g., in `CommunicationPreferences` and `Customer.scheduled_appointments`), are identical in both files.
        *   Both files utilize `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` for model configuration (e.g., `Address.model_config`).
    *   **Methods in `Customer` Class:**
        *   The `to_json()` method is identical in both files, using `self.model_dump_json(indent=4)`.
        *   The static method `get_customer()` is identical in both files.
            *   The parameter name is `current_customer_id` in the method signature.
            *   The docstring argument is named `customer_id` (a minor mismatch, but consistent in both).
    *   **Data Structures & Default/Mock Data:**
        *   The default values for fields within the Pydantic models are identical.
        *   The mock customer data returned by the `get_customer()` method, including nested structures like `billing_address`, `purchase_history` (with all `Product` details), `communication_preferences`, and `garden_profile`, is entirely identical in both files.
    *   **Imports and Licensing:**
        *   Both files have identical import statements: `from typing import List, Dict, Optional` and `from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict`.
        *   The Apache License 2.0 header and module docstring are identical.

*   **Conclusion for Customer Entity:**
    *   The two files, `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/customernew.py` and `agents/customer-service/customer_service/entities/customer.py`, are functionally and structurally identical. There are no differences in the Pydantic model definitions, methods, or the mock data provided.
### 3.5. Prompts (`agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/promptsnew.py` vs. `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py`)

*   **File Paths:**
    *   Compared File 1 (referred to as "Newer Version"): `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/promptsnew.py`
    *   Compared File 2 (referred to as "Current Version"): `agents/customer-service/customer_service/prompts.py`

*   **Key Differences & Observations:**

    *   **Import Paths for `Customer`:**
        *   Identical in both files: `from .entities.customer import Customer` (line 17 in both files).

    *   **Content of `GLOBAL_INSTRUCTION`:**
        *   Identical in both files (lines 19-21 in both files), referencing `Customer.get_customer("123").to_json()`.

    *   **Main `INSTRUCTION` String - Overall:**
        *   **Length and Detail:** The "Current Version" (`prompts.py`) is significantly longer and provides far more detailed instructions and capabilities compared to the "Newer Version" (`promptsnew.py`).
        *   The "Newer Version" (`promptsnew.py`) appears to be a less developed or simplified version of the "Current Version".

    *   **Main `INSTRUCTION` String - Specific Capabilities & Sections:**
        *   **Initial Interaction:**
            *   "Current Version" (`prompts.py`) includes a specific instruction for handling the *very first user message* by seamlessly integrating the greeting with the answer, which is absent in the "Newer Version".
        *   **Product Search Flow:**
            *   "Current Version" (`prompts.py`) outlines a detailed, multi-step process using `search_products`, `get_product_recommendations`, and `format_product_recommendations_for_display` tools, including remembering the original query and formatting for product cards.
            *   "Newer Version" has a more general instruction for product identification without this specific flow or tool chain.
        *   **Image Handling:**
            *   "Current Version" (`prompts.py`) provides extensive instructions for handling user-uploaded static images: acknowledging receipt, objective description, then using `search_products` if relevant.
            *   "Newer Version" only mentions requesting/utilizing *video* for plant identification and lacks specific guidance for static images.
        *   **Accessory Recommendations:**
            *   "Current Version" (`prompts.py`) has a dedicated instruction for recommending accessories (e.g., soil for a plant) by checking product attributes and using `get_product_recommendations` and `format_product_recommendations_for_display`.
            *   "Newer Version" lacks this specific guidance.
        *   **Cart Operations:**
            *   "Current Version" includes more nuanced instructions:
                *   Proactively offering care instructions (`send_care_instructions`) after adding a plant.
                *   Prompting for checkout (`initiate_checkout_ui`) if items are in the cart.
                *   A crucial instruction to *silently* use `access_cart_information` before any cart modification or relevant recommendations.
            *   "Newer Version" has basic cart access and modification instructions.
        *   **UI Control:**
            *   "Current Version" introduces a "UI and Theme Control" capability with the `set_website_theme` tool for changing website appearance (e.g., night/day mode).
            *   This capability is entirely absent in the "Newer Version".

    *   **"Tools" Section within `INSTRUCTION`:**
        *   **Completeness:** "Current Version" (`prompts.py`) lists more tools. Tools present in "Current Version" but missing from "Newer Version" (`promptsnew.py`) include:
            *   `search_products`
            *   `format_product_recommendations_for_display`
            *   `set_website_theme`
            *   `initiate_checkout_ui`
        *   **Detail:**
            *   "Current Version" provides tool signatures with parameters and return types (e.g., `send_call_companion_link(phone_number: str) -> str`).
            *   "Newer Version" tool descriptions are brief and lack parameter/return type details.
            *   The description for `get_product_recommendations` in "Current Version" is more detailed and integrated with the product search flow than in the "Newer Version".

    *   **Unique Constraints or Guidelines:**
        *   Both files share core constraints (markdown for tables, no mention of internal tool workings, confirm actions, be proactive).
        *   "Newer Version" explicitly includes "Don't output code even if user asks for it", which is not listed in the "Current Version's" constraints section.

*   **Conclusion for Prompts:**
    *   The `prompts.py` ("Current Version") file represents a significantly more advanced and feature-rich set of instructions for the AI assistant compared to `promptsnew.py` ("Newer Version").
    *   The "Current Version" details more sophisticated interaction flows (especially for product search and image handling), incorporates more tools for a wider range of capabilities (including UI control and more structured product display), and provides more explicit guidance on tool usage and agent behavior in specific scenarios.
    *   The "Newer Version" (`promptsnew.py`) seems to be either an earlier iteration or a significantly stripped-down version, lacking many of the refined instructions and tools found in the "Current Version" (`prompts.py`).
### 3.6. Tools (`toolsnew.py` vs. `tools/tools.py`)

*   **File Paths:**
    *   New: `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/toolsnew.py`
    *   Current: `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py`

*   **Key Differences &amp; Observations:**

    *   **Implementation (Mocked vs. Actual API Calls):**
        *   **`toolsnew.py`**: All tools are entirely mocked and do not perform any external API calls. It imports `ToolContext` from `google.adk.tools` but does not import `requests` or `json` for API interactions.
        *   **`tools.py`**: Features a mix of mocked tools and tools that make actual HTTP API calls using the `requests` library.
            *   **Actual API Calls in `tools.py`**:
                *   `access_cart_information`: Fetches cart data.
                *   `modify_cart`: Adds/removes items from the cart.
                *   `get_product_recommendations`: Fetches details for a list of product IDs.
                *   `check_product_availability`: Checks product stock.
                *   `search_products`: Searches for products via an API.
            *   **Mocked in `tools.py` (similar to `toolsnew.py` but some with minor differences):** `send_call_companion_link`, `approve_discount`, `sync_ask_for_approval`, `update_salesforce_crm`, `schedule_planting_service`, `get_available_planting_times`, `send_care_instructions`, `generate_qr_code` (QR generation itself is mocked).
            *   **Mocked in `tools.py` (for frontend interaction, not API calls):** `set_website_theme`, `initiate_checkout_ui`.

    *   **Configuration &amp; API Backend:**
        *   **`toolsnew.py`**: Lacks any configuration for a backend API URL.
        *   **`tools.py`**: Imports `Config` from `customer_service.config` to use `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` for all its API calls, with a fallback URL. This allows it to connect to a live backend.

    *   **Error Handling for API Calls:**
        *   **`toolsnew.py`**: Minimal error handling, primarily as simple checks within mocked logic (e.g., discount limits in `approve_discount`).
        *   **`tools.py`**: Implements comprehensive error handling (e.g., `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`, `RequestException`, `json.JSONDecodeError`) for all tools making API calls, returning structured error information.

    *   **Missing Tools:**
        *   The following tools are present in `tools.py` but **absent** in `toolsnew.py`:
            *   `search_products(query: str, customer_id: str)`
            *   `set_website_theme(theme: str)`
            *   `initiate_checkout_ui()`
        *   No tools are present in `toolsnew.py` that are missing from `tools.py`.

    *   **Logic Differences in Common Tools:**
        *   **`approve_discount`**:
            *   `toolsnew.py`: Includes a check: if `value &gt; 10`, it returns `{"status": "rejected", "message": "discount too large. Must be 10 or less."}`. Otherwise, `{"status": "ok"}`. Returns a Python dictionary.
            *   `tools.py`: No such value check. Returns a JSON string: `'{"status": "ok"}'`.
        *   **`sync_ask_for_approval`**:
            *   `toolsnew.py`: Returns a Python dictionary: `{"status": "approved"}`.
            *   `tools.py`: Returns a JSON string: `'{"status": "approved"}'`.
        *   **`get_product_recommendations`**:
            *   **Signature:**
                *   `toolsnew.py`: `get_product_recommendations(plant_type: str, customer_id: str)`
                *   `tools.py`: `get_product_recommendations(product_ids: list[str], customer_id: str)`
            *   **Implementation &amp; Purpose:**
                *   `toolsnew.py`: Mocked; provides generic recommendations based on `plant_type`.
                *   `tools.py`: Makes API calls to fetch and format detailed information (including price, image, product URL) for a given list of `product_ids`.
        *   **`generate_qr_code`**:
            *   `toolsnew.py`: Includes "guardrail" checks for `discount_value` (e.g., `&gt; 10` for percentage, `&gt; 20` for fixed). If a check fails, it returns a simple error string (e.g., `"cannot generate a QR code for this amount, must be 10% or less"`), not a dictionary.
            *   `tools.py`: Does not have these specific discount validation guardrails. It always returns a dictionary.

    *   **Return Values &amp; Frontend Actions:**
        *   **`tools.py`** includes specific `action` keys in return values for some tools, intended to signal actions to a frontend:
            *   `modify_cart` returns `{"action": "refresh_cart", ...}` on success.
            *   `set_website_theme` returns `{"action": "set_theme", "theme": ...}`.
            *   `initiate_checkout_ui` returns `{"action": "trigger_checkout_modal"}`.
        *   `toolsnew.py` does not include these `action` keys for frontend signaling.
        *   As noted, `approve_discount` and `sync_ask_for_approval` return dictionaries in `toolsnew.py` versus JSON strings in `tools.py`.

*   **Conclusion for Tools:**
    The primary difference is that `tools.py` is significantly more feature-rich and integrated with a backend system. It makes actual API calls for core e-commerce functionalities like cart management, product information, availability checks, and search, and includes robust error handling and configuration for these calls. It also contains additional tools for frontend UI interactions (`set_website_theme`, `initiate_checkout_ui`) and product search (`search_products`) that are absent in `toolsnew.py`.
    `toolsnew.py` serves as a purely mocked version of a subset of the tools found in `tools.py`. While some mocked tools are identical, others like `approve_discount`, `get_product_recommendations`, and `generate_qr_code` have notable differences in logic, signature, or internal validation. The return types also differ for some tools (dictionary vs. JSON string). `tools.py` is designed for a live environment, whereas `toolsnew.py` appears suited for testing agent logic without external dependencies or for a simpler, non-connected version of the agent.
### 3.7. Project Configuration (`pyprojectnew.toml` vs. `pyproject.toml`)

*   **File Paths:**
    *   New: `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/pyprojectnew.toml`
    *   Current: `agents/customer-service/pyproject.toml`

*   **Key Differences & Observations:**
    *   **`google-cloud-aiplatform` Version:**
        *   The `new` configuration (`pyprojectnew.toml`) uses version `^1.93.0`.
        *   The `current` configuration (`pyproject.toml`) uses version `^1.88.0`.
        *   This applies to both main dependencies and development dependencies.
    *   **`google-adk` Dependency:**
        *   The `new` configuration (`pyprojectnew.toml`) includes `google-adk = "^0.5.0"` as a main dependency.
        *   The `current` configuration (`pyproject.toml`) does *not* include `google-adk` as a main dependency.
    *   **`requests` Dependency:**
        *   The `new` configuration (`pyprojectnew.toml`) does *not* include `requests` as a main dependency.
        *   The `current` configuration (`pyproject.toml`) includes `requests = "^2.31.0"` as a main dependency.
    *   **Other Dependencies:** Other main and development dependencies (e.g., `pydantic-settings`, `tabulate`, `pytest`) have consistent versions across both files.
    *   **`tool.pytest.ini_options`:**
        *   The configurations under `tool.pytest.ini_options` (new) and `tool.pytest.ini_options` (current) are functionally identical. There are minor formatting differences (e.g., inline vs. multi-line arrays for `markers` and `filterwarnings`)), and slight variations in quoting or spacing for other options, but the effective settings are the same.
    *   **`tool.pyink`:**
        *   The configurations under `tool.pyink` (new) and `tool.pyink` (current) are functionally identical, with minor spacing differences around the `=` sign for `line-length` and `pyink-indentation`.

*   **Conclusion for Project Configuration:**
    The primary differences between `pyprojectnew.toml` and `pyproject.toml` lie in dependency management. The `new` configuration updates `google-cloud-aiplatform` to a newer version (`^1.93.0` from `^1.88.0`), introduces `google-adk` as a dependency, and removes the `requests` library. Tool configurations for `pytest` and `pyink` remain consistent in functionality despite minor formatting variations.
### 3.8. README (`READMEnew.md` vs. `README.md`)

**Overall Comparison:**
The two README files, `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/READMEnew.md` and `agents/customer-service/README.md`, are structurally very similar. Most sections (Overview, Agent Details, Key Features, Setup, Running, Evaluating, Configuration, Deployment) share nearly identical textual content. The primary differences lie in file path accuracy, the described agent's tool implementation (mocked vs. API-connected), and minor discrepancies in the listed tools versus actual code. `READMEnew.md` also includes a "Disclaimer" section not present in the provided version of `README.md`.

**File Paths:**
*   **`READMEnew.md` (New - located in `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/`):**
    *   The reference to `customer_service_workflow.png` (line 23) is likely incorrect if the image is not duplicated into the `customer_servicenew` directory; it currently points to `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/customer_service_workflow.png` while the image exists at `agents/customer-service/customer_service_workflow.png`.
    *   References to code files like `./customer_service/tools/tools.py` (line 27), `./customer_service/entities/customer.py` (line 66), and `./customer_service/config.py` (lines 137, 232) are **incorrect**. They point to a non-existent `customer_service` subdirectory within `customer_servicenew`. The actual corresponding files are `toolsnew.py`, `customernew.py`, and `confignew.py` directly within the `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/` directory.
    *   The `cd adk-samples/agents/customer-service` command in the "Installation" section (line 114) is misleading given `READMEnew.md` resides within the `customer_servicenew` subfolder.
*   **`README.md` (Current - located in `agents/customer-service/`):**
    *   References to `customer_service_workflow.png` (line 23), `./customer_service/tools/tools.py` (line 27), `./customer_service/entities/customer.py` (line 66), and `./customer_service/config.py` (lines 137, 232) are **correct** relative to its location and the existing `customer_service` subdirectory structure.
    *   The `cd adk-samples/agents/customer-service` command (line 114) is **correct**.

*   **Key Differences & Observations:**
    *   **Tool Implementation:**
        *   `READMEnew.md` describes an agent whose tools (defined in `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew/toolsnew.py`) are primarily **mocked**, returning hardcoded data for operations like cart access, product recommendations, etc.
        *   `README.md` describes an agent whose tools (defined in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py`) are implemented to **interact with a backend API** for many of these functions.
*   **Tool List Consistency (`READMEnew.md` vs. `toolsnew.py`):**
    *   All 12 tools listed in `READMEnew.md` (lines 72-83) are present in `toolsnew.py`.
    *   Minor type hint differences exist:
        *   `update_salesforce_crm`: README lists `details: str`, while `toolsnew.py` defines `details: dict`.
        *   `modify_cart`: README lists `items_to_add: list, items_to_remove: list`, while `toolsnew.py` defines `items_to_add: list[dict], items_to_remove: list[dict]`. The code's types are more precise.
*   **Tool List Consistency (`README.md` vs. `tools.py`):**
    *   The 12 tools listed in `README.md` (lines 72-83) are present in `tools.py`.
    *   However, `tools.py` contains **additional tools not mentioned in `README.md`**:
        *   `search_products(query: str, customer_id: str)`
        *   `set_website_theme(theme: str)`
        *   `initiate_checkout_ui()`
    *   Significant discrepancy for `get_product_recommendations`:
        *   `README.md` describes it as `get_product_recommendations(plant_type: str, customer_id: str)`.
        *   `tools.py` implements it as `get_product_recommendations(product_ids: list[str], customer_id: str)`, which fetches details for specific product IDs rather than recommending based on plant type.
    *   Minor type hint differences similar to `READMEnew.md` for `update_salesforce_crm` and `modify_cart`.

*   **Conclusion for READMEs:**
    *   `READMEnew.md` is largely a copy of `README.md` adapted for the `customer_servicenew` agent variant (which uses mocked tools). Its main drawback is the significant number of incorrect file path references to its own associated code files and a potentially misleading setup instruction.
    *   `README.md` (current) is generally accurate in its file path references but fails to fully document its associated tools in `agents/customer-service/customer_service/tools/tools.py`. It omits some available tools and misrepresents the functionality of the `get_product_recommendations` tool.
    *   Both READMEs require updates to accurately reflect their respective agent's codebase, particularly concerning file paths for `READMEnew.md` and tool descriptions/completeness for `README.md`.
## 4. Isolated Improvements in `customer_servicenew` for Potential Merging

Despite its overall outdated state, `customer_servicenew` contains a few pieces of logic that could be considered for integration into the current, more advanced agent:

1.  **Active Use of `after_tool_callback`:**
    *   The `customer_servicenew/agent new.py` registers an `after_tool_callback`. The current agent (`customer_service/agent.py`) does not. Activating this callback (using the existing logic in `customer_service/shared_libraries/callbacks.py`) could allow for deterministic actions or logging after a tool executes.
2.  **Stricter Discount Logic in `approve_discount` Tool:**
    *   The `customer_servicenew/toolsnew.py` version of `approve_discount` has explicit logic to reject discounts over a certain value (e.g., if `value > 10`). This is a good safety measure compared to the current tool's behavior which always approves.
3.  **Enhanced Discount Guardrails in `generate_qr_code` Tool:**
    *   The `customer_servicenew/toolsnew.py` version of `generate_qr_code` includes explicit discount value validation guardrails. The current tool's mock implementation lacks these.
4.  **"Don't output code" Prompt Constraint:**
    *   `customer_servicenew/promptsnew.py` includes an explicit constraint: `*   Don't output code even if user asks for it.` Adding this to the current prompts could enhance agent safety.
5.  **Library Version Review:**
    *   `customer_servicenew/pyprojectnew.toml` uses a newer `google-cloud-aiplatform` version (`^1.93.0` vs. `^1.88.0`) and explicitly lists `google-adk`. Investigating these updates for the current agent (while ensuring `requests` and other dependencies are maintained and compatible) could be beneficial.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Current Agent:** Continue development and focus on the `agents/customer-service/customer_service` implementation, as it is far more functional and advanced.
2.  **Selectively Merge Improvements:** Integrate the isolated beneficial logic pieces from `customer_servicenew` (as listed in section 4) into the current agent to enhance its robustness and safety.
3.  **Archive/Clarify `customer_servicenew`:** To avoid confusion, the `agents/customer-service/customer_servicenew` directory should be archived, clearly marked as outdated/experimental, or removed if it serves no ongoing purpose.
4.  **Update Main README.md:** The primary `agents/customer-service/README.md` needs significant updates to accurately reflect the current agent's API-integrated tools, advanced features, and correct file paths. The tool list and descriptions, in particular, require revision.
